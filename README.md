# APHex
Code for my Raspberry Pi-powered 3-DOF hexapod robot.

This is the code for a Hexapod robot I made. I used a lot of inverse kinematics equations which run in C and have Python bindings attached so they can be called from the main I/O code, which is written in Python.

Before using the C code, it needs to be built. To do this, run these commands:

```bash
Python
